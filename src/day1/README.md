## About

It's a pretty easy problem so I wanted to have some fun with it after solving.

The goal is to make a console based "dial" that would indicate we're spinning / moving
the dial in a direction.

- Show some ticks & numbers to represent where we are on the dial
- An arrow to give placement to our current position
- Ouptut the instruction we're trying to read from our `input`
- Our `Last` position and where we're aiming (`->`) to be `Next`
- After we're done all the instructions output the passwords
