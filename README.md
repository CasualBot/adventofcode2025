# Advent of Code 2025

Code for [Advent of code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
---

1. Each day should be contained within it's own folder
2. Each folder contains the following 
  * `index.js` -> the code to solve the problem
  * `input` - a plain text file to store your puzzle input provided from AoC 2025
3. Do not commit the `input` for each day - they are unique to each user
4. Do not copy problem text from AoC to this repo at their request 

> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.
